-------------- TYPES OF EVENTS -----------------
Event: signal generated by certain dom node, a signal means something has happened


mouseenter event: hover event just like in css


---------------- ANNOTHER WAY OF LISTENING TO EVENTS (old way) ----------------

element.onevent  =  handleEvent 

eg :  h1.onmouseenter = function (e) {console.log(e)}

There is always a onEVENTS property for each of EVENTS



Two advantages of addEventListener :
-We can add multiple event handlers to same element and they will run synchronously, but if we do the same with onEVENT method, the second function will simply override the first one
-We can remove event handler if we don't need it anymore


---------------------REMOVING EVENT LISTENERS --------------------

1-for this, first we create a handler function

function handleClick(){
    console.log('clicked)
}


2-then add event listener

h1.addEventListener('click', handleClick)

3-then we go to our handler function and remove event listener

function handleClick(){
    console.log('clicked)

??    h1.removeEventListener('click', handleClick)       // This does not necessarily have to be here, we can place this line at any point in our code, even inside a timeout function
}
